    "text": "What is surveillance?\n\nEpidemiologic surveillance is the ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data in the process of describing and monitoring a health event. This information is used for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health interventions and programs. Surveillance data are used both to determine the need for public health action and to assess the effectiveness of programs. (Klaucke et al., 1988)\nAnimal health surveillance: The systematic (continuous or repeated) measurement, collection, collation, analysis, interpretation, and timely dissemination of animal-health and -welfare data from defined populations. These data are essential for describing health-hazard occurrence and to contribute to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk-mitigation actions. (Hoinville et al., 2012)"
